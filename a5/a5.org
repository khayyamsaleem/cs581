* Chapter 6 Exercises
1) _Claim_: If player /A/ in a two-person game has a dominant strategy s_A, then there is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium in which player /A/ plays s_A and player /B/ plays a best response to s_A.
   - *False*, because Nash equilibria are formed when neither player possesses a strictly dominant strategy. Since the statement indicates that player /A/ DOES have a dominant strategy, a Nash equilibrim cannot form.
2) _Claim_: In a Nash equilibrium of a two-player game each player is playing an optimal strategy, so the two playerâ€™s strategies are social-welfare maximizing.
   - *False*, by the Prisoner's Dilemma. If both the players play optimal strategies, the net payoff is ~-2~. However, the Nash equilibrium will yield a payoff of ~(-4,-4)~, which yields a net payoff of ~-8~. Hence, players' strategies do NOT yield maximum social-welfare.
3) Find all pure strategy Nash equilibria in the game below:

    Unique pure strategy Nash equilibria: ~(3,2), (2,4)~.
    | P_A Strategy | P_B Strategy | Net PayOff |
    |-------------+-------------+------------|
    | ~U~    (1)  | ~R~     (2) | ~(3,2)~    |
    | ~D~    (1)  | ~L~     (2) | ~(2,4)~    |
    | ~D~    (2)  | ~L~     (1) | ~(3,2)~    |
    | ~U~    (2)  | ~R~     (1) | ~(2,4)~    |

4) Consider the two-player game with players, strategies and payoffs described in the following game matrix:

   a) Does either player have a dominant strategy? Explain briefly.
      - Player /B/ has a dominant strategy, because strategy /L/ pays off for player /B/ regardless of the strategy chosen by player /A/.
   b) Find all pure strategy Nash equilibria for this game.
      - Unique Nash equilibria: ~(5,3), (6,2), (7,0), (5,3), (2,3), (0,3)~

       | P_A Strategy | P_B Strategy | Net PayOff |
       |-------------+-------------+------------|
       | ~b~   (2)   | ~L~   (1)   | ~(5,3)~    |
       | ~t~   (2)   | ~M~   (1)   | ~(6,2)~    |
       | ~m~   (2)   | ~R~   (1)   | ~(7,0)~    |
       | ~b~   (1)   | ~L~   (2)   | ~(5,3)~    |
       | ~m~   (1)   | ~L~   (2)   | ~(2,3)~    |
       | ~t~   (1)   | ~L~   (2)   | ~(0,3)~    |
       
5) Consider the following two-player game in which each player has three strategies. Find all the (pure strategy) Nash equilibria for this game.

       | P_A Strategy | P_B Strategy | Net PayOff |
       |-------------+-------------+------------|
       | ~U~   (1)   | ~R~   (2)   | ~(1,6)~    |
       | ~M~   (1)   | ~M~   (2)   | ~(5,5)~    |
       | ~D~   (1)   | ~L~   (2)   | ~(1,10)~   |
       | ~M~   (2)   | ~L~   (1)   | ~(3,4)~    |
       | ~M~   (2)   | ~M~   (1)   | ~(5,5)~    |
       | ~M~   (2)   | ~R~   (1)   | ~(2,2)~    |

* Chapter 8 Exercises
2) There are two cities A and B joined by two routes. There are 80 travelers who begin in city A and must travel to city B. There are two routes between A and B. Route I begins with a highway leaving city A, this highway takes one hour of travel time regardless of how many travelers use it, and ends with a local street leading into city B. This local street near city B requires a travel time in minutes equal to 10 plus the number of travelers who use the street. Route II begins with a local street leaving city A, which requires a travel time in minutes equal to 10 plus the number of travelers who use this street, and ends with a highway into city B which requires one hour of travel time regardless of the number of travelers who use this highway.
