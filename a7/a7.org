* Chapter 12 Exercises
1) Suppose a network exchange theory experiment is run on the graph depicted in Figure 12.10 using the one-exchange rule. Say which node or nodes you would expect to make the most money (i.e. receive the most favorable exchanges), and give a brief (1-3 sentence) explanation for your answer.

   - Nodes /a/, /c/, and /d/ would make the most favorable exchanges in this network, as each of them are in a position to starve a neighboring node, whose only option is one of the three mentioned. Despite Node /b/ having the maximum /satiability/ of the 7 nodes present, the nodes on the periphery, Nodes /f/, /e/, and /g/, will not want to be left out of exchanges, so they will make better deals for Nodes /a/, /c/, and /d/, stripping Node /b/ of her benefit.
     
2) Suppose a network exchange theory experiment is run on the graph depicted in Figure 12.11 (i.e. a graph that is a 3-node path), using the one-exchange rule.\\
   Now you, playing the role of a fourth node /d/, are told to attach by a single edge to one of the nodes in the network. How should you attach to the network to put yourself in as powerful a position as possible, where power will be determined by the result of a network exchange theory experiment run on the resulting 4-node network? Give a brief explanation of your answer.

   - The position that maximizes my power the most is the one that will unseat the power in the network the most. Rather than attach myself to Node /b/, increasing her power and reducing that of Node /a/, Node /c/, and myself, I should attach myself to either Node /a/ or Node /c/. This action will have the effect of unseating Node /b/ and reducing her power in the network, while giving Nodes /c/ or /a/ an alternative to exchanging with /b/ and increasing their power, thus increasing my own.

* John Nash
In high school, during my class on Discrete Mathematics, we watched the dramatic biography of John Nash, /A Beautiful Mind/. It followed his career as a game theorist, but also depicted his troubled mind as a schizophrenic. A day after we watched the movie in class, John Nash passed away in a taxi crash.
